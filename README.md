HLTV Top 30 rank analysis tool

## Results
I have posted the results of this [here](https://www.hltv.org/forums/threads/2842404/top-30-analysis).

## Purpose
This was just a very quick fun project involving HTML parsing in C, something I have not done too much with, but I am interesting in learning more into networking and webserver design, so I thought this would be a fun project.
